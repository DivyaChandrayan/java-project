 Advanced  Java  Project -  
Broadcasting Chat Server Project

Objective - Chatting or Teleconferencing is a process of utilizing technology to bring people and their ideas together despite of the geographical obstacles. Chat server has two types of broadcasting. One is Public i.e. the message is broadcast to all connected users and another one is Private that means the broadcasting will be limited between two clients. The users have the ability to share all kinds of information to other users also such as transferring of various files, records, voice mails, photos etc. Here I made a private type of broadcasting project between a server and a client.
Users Of System - Since this project is of Private Broadcasting System , so its end users are Client and Server.
Functional Requirement of User - The Broadcasting Chat Server Project that is required to run this project is JRE or the Java Run time Environment software and the users interact with the server by GUI i.e. Graphical User Interface.
Tools Used -  For software requirement we need a JDK , Eclipse or Netbeans (I used netbeans) or notepad is optional. Here I used core java and jFrames to built this project.


Working of Project  -  Here we have Text Fields, message area and a Send button  in both server and client frame or screen.
             When client sends some text message to server it will display on the server text area, similarly when server reply to the client it will displays in clients text area.
                 
   Here we use Buttons, lables , text fileds and text area features of jFrames.  Buttons send the data , labels are client and server  , text area is where messsge displays, and text fileds are where we type the message.
